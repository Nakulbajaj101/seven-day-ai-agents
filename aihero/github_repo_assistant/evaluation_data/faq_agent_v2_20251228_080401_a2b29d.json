This is particularly beneficial when starting from scratch without access to real data, or when there is a need to scale a manually designed dataset with more variation.\n\n2. **Testing Edge Cases and Robustness**: Synthetic data can be created to specifically test edge cases, adversarial inputs, or other scenarios that may be difficult to capture with real-world data. This helps in assessing the robustness of AI systems under diverse conditions.\n\n3. **Controlled Variations**: By adding controlled variations in datasets, synthetic data allows for the evaluation of specific weaknesses or behaviors of machine learning models. This focus on specific attributes enables a more thorough assessment.\n\n4. **Application in Complex Systems**: In the context of complex AI systems, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or AI agents, synthetic data helps in generating input-output datasets from knowledge bases and facilitates multi-turn interactions across various scenarios that are hard to design manually.\n\n5. **Efficient Evaluation**: It serves as a practical approach to expand the evaluation dataset efficiently, while expert human oversight can be directed towards higher-value areas of testing, ensuring a balanced evaluation strategy.\n\nOverall, synthetic data is not a substitute for real data or well-designed tests; instead, it enhances the evaluation process, allowing teams to cover a broader range of scenarios more efficiently ([source](https://github.com/evidentlyai/docs/tree/main/docs-main/synthetic-data/why_synthetic.mdx)).", "id": null, "provider_details": null, "part_kind": "text"}], "usage": {"input_tokens": 1276, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "cache_read_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 326, "input_audio_tokens": 0, "cache_audio_read_tokens": 0, "output_audio_tokens": 0, "details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "timestamp": "2025-12-28T08:04:01.098106Z", "kind": "response", "provider_name": "openai", "provider_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/", "provider_details": {"finish_reason": "stop", "timestamp": "2025-12-28T08:03:54Z"}, "provider_response_id": "chatcmpl-Crg2kjvQXIoTk5WZxnIJVoljUyTuK", "finish_reason": "stop", "run_id": "c6ce585c-377e-42f3-bed8-734279464443", "metadata": null}], "source": "ai-generated"}
